This repository contains the complete configuration and documentation for my homelab Kubernetes cluster. The cluster runs on Talos Linux and serves as a learning platform and hosting environment for various services and applications that I create.

## Documentation

The documentation is published at [anton.golebiowski.dev](https://anton.golebiowski.dev).

The documentation serves as my personal journal, providing a detailed, step-by-step description of how I built and configured the cluster. It captures my learning journey, including decisions made, problems encountered, and solutions implemented. 

> [!WARNING]
> The documentation is written incrementally as I build and improve the cluster. This means that earlier chapters might contain approaches or decisions that were later revised or improved in subsequent chapters. The most up-to-date configuration should be available at [Quickstart](https://anton.golebiowski.dev/99_quickstart) guide.
