# Minecraft

With persistance layer I have all the pieces to setup some application that uses persistent volume claims. I chose Minecraft Bedrock server. Initial setup was quite simple, all I had to do was to prepare PVC and use [minecraft bedrock server](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server) docker image with proper configuration.

## PVC
YAML file with configuration of Persistent Volume Claim:
```yaml
# minecraft-pvc.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: bds
  annotations:
    volumeType: local
    volume.kubernetes.io/selected-node: worker0
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: local-path
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

This configuration is stored in a separate file and is created once. What is worth noting is that PVC is assigned to a specific cluster node. Stateful set that will use this PVC will follow that and the application will be deployed on the same node.

## Secrets 
There are two environmental variables that I want to keep out of the Git repository:

1. players whitelist that contain usernames and identifiers of players allowed on the server
2. identifier of players that have admin priviliges (operators)

I decided to keep values of those in YAML **Secret**:
```yaml
# minecraft-secrets.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: minecraft-secrets
  labels:
    role: service-secrets
    app: bds
type: Opaque
stringData:
  # https://www.cxkes.me/xbox/xuid -> copy XUID (DEC)
  ALLOW_LIST_USERS: <secret>
  OPS: <secret>
```

This file is encrypted using GPG and kept in the repository with proper values.

## Application YAML
Main YAML file that contains **ConfigMap**, **StatefulSet** and **Service** looks like this:
```yaml
# minecraft.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: minecraft
  labels:
    role: service-config
    app: bds
data:
  # Find more options at https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-bedrock-server#server-properties
  # Remove # from in front of line if changing from default values.
  EULA: "TRUE" # Must accept EULA to use this minecraft server
  TZ: "Europe/Warsaw"
  GAMEMODE: "survival" # Options: survival, creative, adventure
  DIFFICULTY: "normal" # Options: peaceful, easy, normal, hard
  DEFAULT_PLAYER_PERMISSION_LEVEL: "member" # Options: visitor, member, operator
  LEVEL_NAME: "MC Anton"
  LEVEL_SEED: "1429753401291899097"
  SERVER_NAME: "MC Anton"
  #SERVER_PORT: "19132"
  #LEVEL_TYPE: "DEFAULT" # Options: FLAT, LEGACY, DEFAULT
  #ALLOW_CHEATS: "false" # Options: true, false
  MAX_PLAYERS: "10"
  #PLAYER_IDLE_TIMEOUT: "30"
  #TEXTUREPACK_REQUIRED: "false" # Options: true, false
  #
  ## Changing these will have a security impact
  ONLINE_MODE: "true" # Options: true, false (removes Xbox Live account requirements)
  #WHITE_LIST: "true" # If enabled, need to provide a whitelist.json by your own means.
  # 
  # allowed users are taken from secrets
  # ALLOW_LIST_USERS: todo:todo
  ## Changing these will have a performance impact
  #VIEW_DISTANCE: "10"
  #TICK_DISTANCE: "4"
  #MAX_THREADS: "8"

## Backup

Minecraft worlds should be backed up and kept in a separate storage in case of world corruption, PVC error or just accidental deletion. For now I decided to go with a simple script created with ChatGPT that creates a zip file with PVC content and copies it on my computer. This will be done properly in the future. The script content:
```sh
#!/bin/bash

set -e

STATEFULSET="bds"
PVC_NAME="bds"
NAMESPACE="default"
TMP_POD_NAME="pvc-backup-temp"
LOCAL_BACKUP_FILE="bds-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).zip"

echo "üîΩ Scaling down StatefulSet $STATEFULSET..."
kubectl scale statefulset $STATEFULSET --replicas=0 --namespace $NAMESPACE

echo "‚è± Waiting for pods to terminate..."
sleep 30

echo "üì¶ Creating temporary pod to mount PVC..."
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: $TMP_POD_NAME
  namespace: $NAMESPACE
spec:
  nodeName: worker0
  containers:
  - name: backup
    image: joshkeegan/zip:3.21.3
    command: [ "sh", "-c", "cd /data && zip -r /tmp/bds.zip . && sleep 3600" ]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: bds-vol
      mountPath: /data
  volumes:
  - name: bds-vol
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: $PVC_NAME
  restartPolicy: Never
EOF

echo "üïê Waiting for pod to be Ready..."
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod/$TMP_POD_NAME --timeout=60s --namespace $NAMESPACE

echo "üìÅ Copying data from PVC to local zip file..."
kubectl exec -n $NAMESPACE $TMP_POD_NAME -- sh -c "cd /data && zip -r /tmp/bds.zip ."
kubectl cp $NAMESPACE/$TMP_POD_NAME:/tmp/bds.zip $LOCAL_BACKUP_FILE

echo "üßπ Cleaning up temporary pod..."
kubectl delete pod $TMP_POD_NAME --namespace $NAMESPACE

echo "‚¨ÜÔ∏è Scaling StatefulSet $STATEFULSET back to 1..."
kubectl scale statefulset $STATEFULSET --replicas=1 --namespace $NAMESPACE

echo "‚úÖ Backup complete: $LOCAL_BACKUP_FILE"
```

## Setup

To sum up, in order to setup Minecraft server using the above you have to:

1. Apply YAML PVC configuration - this will create storage for server data
2. Apply YAML secrets - this will create secrets containing *ALLOW_LIST_USERS* and *OPS* variables
3. Apply remaining YAML - this will create configuration map, stateful set that will take care of running pod with minecraft server and service so that the server can be connected to.

If you need to do any changes YAML configurations with secrets and application can be deleted and applied as much as you need to. PVC is created once and cannot be deleted without data loss.
